# Range Extraction
#
# A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either:
# - individual integers
# - or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range
#   by a dash, "-". The range includes all integers in the interval inclluding both endpoints. It is not 
#   considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For exampe "12,13,15-17"
#
# Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted
# string int the range format.
